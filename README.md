# Java OOP Based Simple Interpreter: cli application 🚀

## Overview 🌟

This project is a simple mathematical interpreter developed in Java, which calculates complex mathematical expressions. The interpreter is designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and does not utilize a stack for evaluation. It supports variable declarations and can handle both integer and float values, as well as mathematical expressions as variable values.

## Features 🔧

- **Complex Mathematical Expression Evaluation**: Calculate intricate mathematical expressions. 📐
- **Variable Declaration**: Declare variables that can be used in other expressions. 📝
- **Support for Integers and Floats**: Handle both integer and floating-point numbers. 🔢
- **OOP Principles**: Utilizes Object-Oriented Programming concepts for modular design and maintainability. 💻
